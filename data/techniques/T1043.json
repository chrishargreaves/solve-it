    "description": "The decoding of a forensic format such as EWF such that the raw sectors can be accessed by a forensic tool (typically performed on-the-fly internally in a tool.)",
    "synonyms": ["Read forensic format", "Read forensic image"],
    "details": "For example a EWF (Expert Witness Format) needs to be processed to expose the equivalent RAW image sectors. Therefore both the input and output types here are [https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/Image]. This technique would not need to be used when working with a RAW image format directly. This also includes decoding logical formats such as L01, AD1, CTR, or AFF4-L. The output here is not an image file but rather a set of files and their metadata",
