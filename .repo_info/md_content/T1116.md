# T1116

**ID:** T1116

**Name:** Determine connected devices

**Description:**

Examine artefacts and extract indicators of devices that have been connected to the target device.

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- USB connected devices
- ADB connected hosts
- iOS Backups from a computer


**CASE Output Classes:**

    - observable:Device
    - observable:Computer
    - observable:MobileDevice
    - observable:SmartDevice
    - observable:WearableDevice


**Potential weaknesses and mitigations:**

- [W1183](W1183.md): Failure to identify the existence of a connected device _(INCOMP)_
    - M1027: Dual tool verification 
    - M1134: Testing that connected devices are detected. 
- [W1184](W1184.md): Presenting devices 'seen' as devices connected _(INAC-EX, INAC-AS, MISINT)_
    - M1027: Dual tool verification 
    - M1135: Testing that correct metadata/status of connected devices is extracted 
    - M1050: Manual verification of relevant data 
- [W1011](W1011.md): Suggesting the existence of a device that does not exist _(INAC-EX)_
    - M1058: Checking for other confirmatory indicators of the inferred device's existence. 
    - M1027: Dual tool verification
