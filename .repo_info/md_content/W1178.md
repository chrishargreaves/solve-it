# W1178

**Name:** Inability to load the forensic bootable environment due to system configuration

**Weakness classes:** INCOMP

**Potential mitigations:**

- M1128: Use a Trusted Bootable Environment that is permitted to boot 
- M1129: Use USB flashdrive version if a CD version is not permitted to boot 
- M1130: Disable Secureboot in BIOS to permit bootable environment to load (risks wiping FDE key, requiring ADK).
