**Output Classes:**



**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1025](W1025.md): Data relevant to the case is excluded as part of the filtering process _(INCOMP)_
    - M1010: Perform full extraction instead of selective 
    - M1011: Perform full extraction instead of selective, followed by partial processing 
- [W1026](W1026.md): Selective extraction of a backup implies partial collection when it is in reality a full collection followed by deletion. _(MISINT)_
    - M1012: Clear presentation of the backup and deletion process 
- [W1027](W1027.md): Including data that was meant to be excluded with the selected filters _(INAC-AS)_
- [W1028](W1028.md): Due to the use of time based filters data extracted may be presented out of context _(INAC-AS)_
    - M1010: Perform full extraction instead of selective 
    - M1011: Perform full extraction instead of selective, followed by partial processing
