    - [M1010: Perform full extraction instead of selective](M1010.md)
    - [M1011: Perform full extraction instead of selective, followed by partial processing](M1011.md)
- [W1026: Selective extraction of a backup implies partial collection when it is in reality a full collection followed by deletion.](W1026.md) _(MISINT)_
    - [M1012: Clear presentation of the backup and deletion process](M1012.md)
- [W1027: Including data that was meant to be excluded with the selected filters](W1027.md) _(INAC-AS)_
- [W1028: Due to the use of time based filters data extracted may be presented out of context](W1028.md) _(INAC-AS)_
    - [M1010: Perform full extraction instead of selective](M1010.md)
