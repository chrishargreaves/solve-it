# T1113

**ID:** T1113

**Name:** Access internal storage via bootable environment

**Description:**

Booting the suspected computer device into forensically-sound bootable software-write blocked operating system in order to image the disks.

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- WinFE - Windows Forensic Environment, is forensically sound, bootable Windows operation system that can be burned into USB and plug the USB into suspected device. Then, after changing boot order, booting to the USB to create forensic images from the tested Windows, MacOS and Linux systems.
- PALADIN Forensic - is a modified “live” Linux distribution based on Ubuntu that simplifies various forensics tasks in a forensically sound manner via the PALADIN Toolbox.

**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1177](W1177.md): Failing to boot from intended forensic bootable environment, causing the normal system boot process to commence _(INAC-ALT, INAC-COR)_
    - M1126: Use forensic bootable environment to gain access to internal media ([T1113](T1113.md))
    - M1127: Use a similar system to test steps required to interrupt the normal boot process and boot from Trusted Bootable Environment 
- [W1178](W1178.md): Inability to load the forensic bootable environment due to system configuration _(INCOMP)_
    - M1128: Use a Trusted Bootable Environment that is permitted to boot 
    - M1129: Use USB flashdrive version if a CD version is not permitted to boot 
    - M1130: Disable Secureboot in BIOS to permit bootable environment to load (risks wiping FDE key, requiring ADK). 
- [W1179](W1179.md): Failure to detect internal disk from bootable environment _(INCOMP)_
    - M1131: Use a Trusted Bootable Environment that supports accessing the internal disk 
- [W1180](W1180.md): Failing to decrypt internal disk using the bootable environment _(INCOMP)_
    - M1132: Use a Trusted Bootable Environment that supports decryption of the internal disk 
    - M1133: Acquire the encrypted contents of the internal disk and decrypt the copy within a virtualized environment
