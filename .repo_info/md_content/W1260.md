# W1260

**Name:** Failure to derive clock offset due to inability to locate a suitable time anchor

**Weakness classes:** INCOMP

**Details:** None

**Present in techniques:**

- [T1134: Use time anchors to estimate clock offset](T1134.md)


**Potential mitigations:**

- [M1222: Testing to ensure that tooling is able to extract local/external timestamp pairs (time anchors)](M1222.md)
- [M1218: Ensure that tools and processes take into account all current knowledge on sources of local/external timestamp pairs (time anchors)](M1218.md)
