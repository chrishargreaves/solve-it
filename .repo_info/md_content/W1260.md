# W1260

**Name:** Failure to derive clock offset due to inability to locate a suitable time anchor

**Weakness classes:** INCOMP

**Details:** None

**Potential mitigations:**

- M1222: Testing to ensure that tooling is able to extract local/external timestamp pairs (time anchors) 
- M1218: Ensure that tools and processes take into account all current knowledge on sources of local/external timestamp pairs (time anchors)
