# T1117

**ID:** T1117

**Name:** Time-based event reconstruction

**Description:**

The process of assigning a time component to a reconstructed event

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**



**CASE Output Classes:**



**Potential weaknesses and mitigations:**

- [W1148](W1148.md): Timestamp used is an inaccurate representation of the real world time due to inaccurate system clock _(INAC-EX)_
    - M1101: Apply time offset to timestamp ([T1153](T1153.md))
    - M1225: Estimate clock offset at a specific point in time using time anchoring ([T1134](T1134.md))
    - M1227: Search for indicators of clock tampering ([T1129](T1129.md))
    - M1228: Record system clock offset ([T1111](T1111.md))
- [W1149](W1149.md): Failure to determine clock accuracy at time of inferred event _(INAC-EX, MISINT)_
    - M1103: Use 'Time Anchors' to assess clock accuracy at time of inferred event ([T1134](T1134.md))
    - M1227: Search for indicators of clock tampering ([T1129](T1129.md))
    - M1228: Record system clock offset ([T1111](T1111.md))
- [W1150](W1150.md): Misinterpreting events from automated processes as user generated ones _(INAC-EX, MISINT)_
- [W1266](W1266.md): Timestamp used is an inaccurate representation of the real world time due to timezone and/or daylight savings _(INAC-EX)_
    - M1101: Apply time offset to timestamp ([T1153](T1153.md))
    - M1224: Check for location artifacts to infer the time zone at a specific moment 
    - M1229: Determine last timezone used on system 
    - M1230: Ensure that daylight savings offsets that are applied to timestamps are correct
