# T1117

**ID:** T1117

**Name:** Time-based event reconstruction

**Description:**

The process of assigning a time component to a reconstructed event

**Synonyms:**

Temporal-based event reconstruction, 

**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**



**Output Classes:**

- [https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/core/startTime](https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/core/startTime)
- [https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/core/endTime](https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/core/endTime)
- [https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/core/confidence](https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/core/confidence)


**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1148](W1148.md): Timestamp used is an inaccurate representation of the real world time due to inaccurate system clock _(INAC-EX)_
    - M1101: Apply time offset to timestamp ([T1153](T1153.md))
    - M1225: Estimate clock offset at a specific point in time using time anchoring ([T1134](T1134.md))
    - M1227: Search for indicators of clock tampering ([T1129](T1129.md))
    - M1228: Record system clock offset ([T1111](T1111.md))
- [W1149](W1149.md): Failure to consider timestamp inaccuracy at time of inferred event _(INCOMP, INAC-EX, INAC-AS, MISINT)_
    - M1103: Check that analysis of timestamp accuracy on which event reconstruction is based has been performed 
- [W1266](W1266.md): Timestamp used is an inaccurate representation of the real world time due to timezone and/or daylight savings _(INAC-EX)_
    - M1101: Apply time offset to timestamp ([T1153](T1153.md))
    - M1224: Check for location artifacts to infer the time zone at a specific moment 
    - M1229: Determine last timezone used on system 
    - M1230: Ensure that daylight savings offsets that are applied to timestamps are correct
