**ID:** T1010

**Name:** Place device in faraday environment

**Description:**

Place a device in an environment designed to shield a mobile phone or small digital device from radio waves entering the environment and reaching the device, and to stop radio waves escaping from the environment (adapted from Lennox-Steele & Nisbet (2016))

**Synonyms:**

Environment should block: mobile network, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth and all other RF.

**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**



**CASE Output Classes:**



**Potential weaknesses and mitigations:**

- W1115: Device is remote wiped because faraday environment was insufficient. _(INCOMP, INAC-COR)_
    - M1002: Testing of the faraday environment to be used 
- W1116: Last wifi connection is overwritten because faraday environment was insufficient. _(INCOMP, INAC-COR)_
    - M1002: Testing of the faraday environment to be used 
- W1117: Calls, messages or other data was received and overwrote relevant data because faraday environment was insufficient. _(INCOMP, INAC-COR)_
    - M1002: Testing of the faraday environment to be used
