# T1157

**ID:** T1157

**Name:** Extract device data using exposed service

**Objective(s):** Acquire data

**Description:**

Use an exposed service on a device to extract data. This represents several of the mobile data extraction methods e.g. Query content providers (android), AFC (iOS).

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**

- [T1019 - Mobile backup extraction](T1019.md)


**Examples:**

- Extraction of data using AFC on iOS
- Android Debug Bridge (ADB) provides command line access when USB debugging is enabled on Android devices
- Extraction of data by querying Content Providers on Android (via ADB)
- Media Transfer Protocol (MTP)
