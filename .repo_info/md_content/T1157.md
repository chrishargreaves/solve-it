# T1157

**ID:** T1157

**Name:** Extract device data using exposed service

**Description:**

Use an exposed service on a device to extract data. This represents several of the mobile data extraction methods e.g. Query content providers (android), AFC (iOS).

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**

- [T1019 - Mobile backup extraction](T1019.md)


**Examples:**

- Extraction of data using AFC on iOS
- Android Debug Bridge (ADB) provides command line access when USB debugging is enabled on Android devices
- Extraction of data by querying Content Providers on Android (via ADB)
- Media Transfer Protocol (MTP)


**Output Classes:**

**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1037](W1037.md): Presenting data as complete, that is in reality a partial set _(MISINT)_
    - M1016: Alert user that the data collected is a partial set of data stored on the device 
    - M1020: Compare data extracted with full list of installed apps 
- [W1041](W1041.md): Not considering file system acquisition as alternative _(INCOMP)_
    - M1019: Consider if file system acquisition is possible/permitted ([T1020](T1020.md))
- [W1040](W1040.md): Not considering SD Card acquisition in addition to other extractions performed _(INCOMP)_
    - M1017: Check for physical presence of SD card 
    - M1018: Check if presence of SD card is expected 
- [W1271](W1271.md): Inability to access required service as it is not enabled _(INCOMP)_
    - M1232: Configure device to enable required service ([T1158](T1158.md))
- [W1272](W1272.md): Failure to preserve all relevant timestamps of files obtained using exposed services on a device _(INCOMP)_
    - M1233: Test data extraction methods against reference data with known timestamps 
- [W1273](W1273.md): Failure to preserve full resolution of all relevant timestamps of files obtained using exposed services on a device _(INCOMP)_
    - M1233: Test data extraction methods against reference data with known timestamps
