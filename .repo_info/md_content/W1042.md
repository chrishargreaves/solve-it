# W1042

**Name:** Disk image was tampered with, but manipulated to have a collision with original hash

**Weakness classes:** INAC-COR

**Details:** None

**Present in techniques:**

- [T1042: Disk image hash verification](T1042.md)


**Potential mitigations:**

- [M1021: Verify the disk image integrity with multiple hash algorithms e.g. MD5 and SHA1 (Kessler 2016)](M1021.md)
- [M1022: Restrict access to stored disk images](M1022.md)
- [M1023: Ensure and check logs of access to stored disk images](M1023.md)
- [M1070: Ensure hash algorithm(s) used are resistant to collisions through data manipulation](M1070.md)
