# W1042

**Name:** Disk image was tampered with, but manipulated to have a collision with original hash

**Weakness classes:** INAC-COR

**Details:** None

**Mitigations:**

- M1021: Verify the disk image integrity with multiple hash algorithms e.g. MD5 and SHA1 (Kessler 2016) 
- M1022: Restrict access to stored disk images 
- M1023: Ensure and check logs of access to stored disk images 
- M1070: Ensure hash algorithm(s) used are resistant to collisions through data manipulation
