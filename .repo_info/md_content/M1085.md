# M1085

**Name:** Use of multiple tools to verify disk image hash

**Details:** None

**Potentially mitigates:**

- [W1124: Failure to compute hash correctly: this could result in a message indicating corrupt evidence, thus stopping or delaying further investigation](W1124.md)
- [W1125: Failure to validate hash properly: this could allow errors from earlier to propagate e.g. incorrect sectors](W1125.md)
- [W1126: Failure to validate hash properly allowing an incomplete disk image to present as validated](W1126.md)
