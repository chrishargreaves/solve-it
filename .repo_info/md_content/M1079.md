# M1079

**Name:** Analyse file content to detect incompatibility between the content and the recovered file system metadata

**Details:** None

**Potentially mitigates:**

- [W1134: Recovered (non-allocated) file content has been overwritten by the content of a newer, but also non-allocated file (which has residual file system information) but this is not detected ](W1134.md)
- [W1135: Recovered (non-allocated) file content has been overwritten by the content of a newer live file but this is not detected ](W1135.md)
- [W1253: Recovered (non-allocated) file content has been overwritten by the content of a newer, but also non-allocated file which does not have any residual file system information](W1253.md)
- [W1254: Recovered (non-allocated) file content is incorrect due to an incorrect assumption that the file was contiguous e.g. some residual file metadata exists, but not the full reassembly information](W1254.md)
- [W1255: Recovered file content is incorrect due to incorrect parsing of file size information that records allocated but unwritten sectors (e.g. Valid Data Length (VDL)](W1255.md)
- [W1256: Incorrect attribution of metadata to file content that was the result of 'file tunnelling'](W1256.md)
