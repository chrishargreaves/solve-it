# T1071

**ID:** T1071

**Name:** Database examination

**Description:**

Examination of a database file(s) to extract information from within

**Synonyms:**

database forensics, 

**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- sqlite-forensic-corpus (2018), https://faui1-files.cs.fau.de/public/sqlite-forensic-corpus/


**CASE Output Classes:**

    - observable:recordFieldName
    - observable:recordFieldValue
    - observable:recordRowID
    - observable:SQLiteBlob


**Potential weaknesses and mitigations:**

- W1166: Consideration of live database content only _(INCOMP)_
    - M1122: Apply non-allocated record recovery to database file(s) 
    - M1123: Apply system-wide record recovery for non-allocated database record data structures 
- W1167: Combining data from multiple tables that should not be joined _(INAC-AS, INAC-ALT, MISINT)_
    - M1118: Recover appropriate database table joins from source application source code 
    - M1119: Recover appropriate database table joins from source application reverse engineering 
    - M1120: Recover appropriate database table joins from source application developer documentation 
    - M1121: Infer appropriate table joins from extensive experimentation with known ground-truth data ([T1090](T1090.md))
- W1168: Data extracted from a table is assigned an incorrect interpretation _(INAC-ALT, MISINT)_
- W1169: Reliance on a field for historical reconstruction that is subject to updates and preserves only a single value _(INAC-AS, INAC-ALT, MISINT)_
- W1170: Failure to recover data stored in Write Ahead Log (WAL) files _(INCOMP)_
    - M1124: Examine database contents with and without Write Ahead Log (WAL) files applied 
- W1171: Failure to recover data stored in database journal files _(INCOMP)_
    - M1125: Examine database journal files
