# T1043

**ID:** T1043

**Name:** Decode forensic image format

**Description:**

The decoding of a forensic format such as EWF such that the raw sectors can be accessed by a forensic tool (typically performed on-the-fly internally in a tool.)

**Synonyms:**

Read forensic format, Read forensic image, 

**Details:**

For example a EWF (Expert Witness Format) needs to be processed to expose the equivalent RAW image sectors. Therefore both the input and output types here are [https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/Image]. This technique would not need to be used when working with a RAW image format directly. This also includes decoding logical formats such as L01, AD1, CTR, or AFF4-L. The output here is not an image file but rather a set of files and their metadata

**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- Expert Witness Format (EWF)
- Advanced Forensic Format (AFF)


**Output Classes:**

- [https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/Image](https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/Image)
- [https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/File](https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/File)


**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1121](W1121.md): Image format parsing fails to to present all blocks from within a forensic container image in their ‘flat’ (dd) representation _(INCOMP)_
- [W1122](W1122.md): Image format parsing presents incorrect data within sectors of the image _(INAC-ALT)_
- [W1123](W1123.md): Image format parsing presents incorrect forensic image metadata _(INAC-ALT)_
- [W1259](W1259.md): Image format parsing fails to identify or assemble split forensic images _(INCOMP, INAC-COR)_
    - M1004: Check hash of image matches hash of source device ([T1042](T1042.md))
    - M1009: Check hash of image matches hash of source material 
    - M1210: Use a forensic image format with internal integrity and continuity metadata 
    - M1211: Test the parsing of split forensic images 
    - M1212: Test the parsing of split forensic images with the maximum number of segments possible 
    - M1213: Test the parsing of split forensic images with missing segments 
    - M1214: Ensure forensic tool UI clearly warns that there are problems while parsing a split forensic image file 
    - M1215: Test the parsing of split forensic images with a corrupt segment
