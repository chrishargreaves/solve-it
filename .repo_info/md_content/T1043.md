# T1043

**ID:** T1043

**Name:** Forensic image format decoding

**Description:**

The decoding of a forensic format such as EWF such that the raw sectors can be accessed by a forensic tool (typically performed on-the-fly internally in a tool.)

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**



**CASE Output Classes:**



**Potential weaknesses and mitigations:**

- W1121: Image format parsing fails to to present all blocks from within a forensic container image in their ‘flat’ (dd) representation _(INCOMP)_
- W1122: Image format parsing presents incorrect data within sectors of the image _(INAC-ALT)_
- W1123: Image format parsing presents incorrect forensic image metadata _(INAC-ALT)_
- W1259: Image format parsing fails to identify or assemble split forensic images _(INCOMP, INAC-COR)_
    - M1004: Check hash of image matches hash of source device ([T1042](T1042.md))
    - M1009: Check hash of image matches hash of source material 
    - M1210: Use a forensic image format with internal integrity and continuity metadata 
    - M1211: Test the parsing of split forensic images 
    - M1212: Test the parsing of split forensic images with the maximum number of segments possible 
    - M1213: Test the parsing of split forensic images with missing segments 
    - M1214: Ensure forensic tool UI clearly warns that there are problems while parsing a split forensic image file 
    - M1215: Test the parsing of split forensic images with a corrupt segment
