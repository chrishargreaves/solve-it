# T1043

**ID:** T1043

**Name:** Decode forensic image format

**Objective(s):** Read data from digital evidence storage formats

**Description:**

The decoding of a forensic format such as EWF such that the raw sectors can be accessed by a forensic tool (typically performed on-the-fly internally in a tool.)

**Synonyms:**

Read forensic format, Read forensic image, 

**Details:**

For example a EWF (Expert Witness Format) needs to be processed to expose the equivalent RAW image sectors. Therefore both the input and output types here are [https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/Image]. This technique would not need to be used when working with a RAW image format directly. This also includes decoding logical formats such as L01, AD1, CTR, or AFF4-L. The output here is not an image file but rather a set of files and their metadata

**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- Expert Witness Format (EWF)
- Advanced Forensic Format (AFF)


**Output Classes:**

- [https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/Image](https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/Image)
- [https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/File](https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/File)
