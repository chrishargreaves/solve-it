# T1002

**ID:** T1002

**Name:** Disk imaging

**Description:**

Copying of sectors from a storage media, typically LBA~0~ to LBA~max~ into an imaging format. The could be from a traditional hard disk, SSD, USB stick, or data from an eMMC chip that has been desoldered and placed in a reader. 

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- dcfldd
- FTK Imager
- Magnet ACQUIRE


**CASE Output Classes:**

    - observable:Image


**Potential weaknesses and mitigations:**

- W1004: Acquisition does not include all sectors from LBA0 to LBA max _(INCOMP)_
    - M1003: Check image size corresponds with drive label 
    - M1004: Check hash of image matches hash of source device ([T1042](T1042.md))
- W1006: Acquistion does not include data in HPA _(INCOMP)_
    - M1005: Testing to ensure software and hardware setup detects HPAs 
- W1007: Acquistion does not include data in DCO _(INCOMP)_
    - M1006: Testing to ensure software and hardware setup detects DCOs 
- W1013: Acquisition includes extra bytes _(INAC-EX)_
    - M1003: Check image size corresponds with drive label 
    - M1004: Check hash of image matches hash of source device ([T1042](T1042.md))
- W1014: Imaging process changes original data _(INAC-ALT)_
    - M1007: Use hardware write blocker ([T1012](T1012.md))
    - M1008: Use software write blocker ([T1013](T1013.md))
- W1015: Powering on SSD results in sectors being wiped by TRIM operation _(INCOMP, INAC-ALT, INAC-COR)_
- W1016: Data copied from sectors on source device are stored incorrectly _(INAC-ALT, INAC-COR)_
    - M1004: Check hash of image matches hash of source device ([T1042](T1042.md))
- W1136: Not recovering data from a failed hard drive _(INCOMP)_
    - M1089: Attempt physical disk repair 
- W1143: Acquisition method does not read remapped sectors e.g. G-Lists _(INCOMP)_
    - M1102: Apply techniques to read remapped sectors
