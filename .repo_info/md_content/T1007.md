# T1007

**ID:** T1007

**Name:** SyncTriage-based approach

**Description:**

A technique developed in Hargreaves & Marshall (2018) whereby synchronisation artefacts on a device are examined and used to identify the existence of a related device. Also sometimes used to infer activity that occurred on an inaccessible or unavailable device. 

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- SyncTriage - https://bitbucket.org/chrishargreaves/synctriage


**CASE Output Classes:**

    - observable:Device
    - observable:Computer
    - observable:MobileDevice
    - observable:SmartDevice
    - observable:WearableDevice


**Potential weaknesses and mitigations:**

- W1008: Missing the existence of a device by missing synchronisation artefacts _(INCOMP)_
    - M1059: Ongoing research and documentation of syncronisation artefacts 
    - M1057: Testing of parsing of syncronisation artefacts 
    - M1027: Dual tool verification 
- W1009: Missing the existence of a device by incorrectly parsing synchronisation artefacts _(INCOMP)_
    - M1057: Testing of parsing of syncronisation artefacts 
- W1010: Misattributing activity to the wrong device _(INAC-AS)_
    - M1058: Checking for other confirmatory indicators of the inferred device's existence. 
- W1011: Suggesting the existence of a device that does not exist _(INAC-EX)_
    - M1058: Checking for other confirmatory indicators of the inferred device's existence. 
    - M1027: Dual tool verification 
- W1012: Interaction with the target devices to read synronisation artefacts causes changes _(INAC-ALT)_
    - M1007: Use hardware write blocker ([T1012](T1012.md))
    - M1008: Use software write blocker ([T1013](T1013.md))
