# T1025

**ID:** T1025

**Name:** Writing data to a forensic image format

**Description:**

Storage of data recovered from a digital device. Popular formats are RAW, EWF, AFF4 and some proprietary logical formats from other tool vendors. 

**Synonyms:**

Disk image container, image file, 

**Details:**

Formats:

Raw: 

EWF:

AFF: 


The imaged data may be split into several linked container formats. e.g. e01, e02 e03 etc.

**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- 2009 M57-Jean - Data is supplied as a ‘multi-volume Expert Witness file’ - i.e. split EnCase E01 & E02 image files (https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/scenarios/m57-jean/)
- FTK Imager: This tool can be used to acquire data from block devices in various image formats including RAW, EWF, and AFF
- Magnet Acquire: This tool can be used to acquire data from block devices in various image formats including RAW and EWF.
- libewf: This open source library allows access to the EWF format. The accompanying ewftools proves tools to verify, inspect and create EWF images. 


**CASE Output Classes:**



**Potential weaknesses and mitigations:**

- [W1043](W1043.md): Data is written to forensic format that does not preserve the original raw data _(INAC-ALT)_
    - M1009: Check hash of image matches hash of source material
