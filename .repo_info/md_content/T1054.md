# T1054

**ID:** T1054

**Name:** Manual content review for relevant material

**Description:**

Manual examination of files or artifacts to determine their relevance to the investigation.

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**

The result of this process is a classification, which may be 'relevant', or could be more specific, e.g. 'contains reference to x'. This technique is likely paired with T1091 (Bookmark artifacts) but they could be recorded in other ways. This manual review could be of the content of files (T1058), or of content extracted from within files e.g. images (T1081), video (T1080), or audio (T1079).

**Subtechniques:**

**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1060](W1060.md): A relevant piece of media was not flagged as relevant _(INCOMP, INAC-AS)_
    - M1039: Hash matching to reduce need for manual review 
    - M1040: Use of AI to flag potentially relevant content to reduce need for manual review 
    - M1041: Regular breaks to minimise investigator fatigue 
- [W1061](W1061.md): An irrelevant piece of media was flagged as relevant _(INAC-AS)_
    - M1039: Hash matching to reduce need for manual review 
    - M1040: Use of AI to flag potentially relevant content to reduce need for manual review 
    - M1041: Regular breaks to minimise investigator fatigue 
    - M1042: Secondary review of flagged items to ensure relevance 
- [W1062](W1062.md): The grade or specific tag given to item is incorrect _(INAC-AS)_
    - M1039: Hash matching to reduce need for manual review 
    - M1040: Use of AI to flag potentially relevant content to reduce need for manual review 
    - M1041: Regular breaks to minimise investigator fatigue 
    - M1042: Secondary review of flagged items to ensure relevance
