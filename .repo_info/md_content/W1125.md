**Name:** Failure to validate hash properly: this could allow errors from earlier to propagate e.g. incorrect sectors

**Weakness classes:** INAC-COR

**Details:** None

**Present in techniques:**

- [T1042: Disk image hash verification](T1042.md)


**Potential mitigations:**

- [M1075: Testing programme to validate hashes of data in images is calculated correctly](M1075.md)
- [M1085: Use of multiple tools to verify disk image hash](M1085.md)
