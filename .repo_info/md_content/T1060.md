# T1060

**ID:** T1060

**Name:** Enumerate allocated files and folders

**Description:**

This involves parsing the live file system data structures and reconstructing the file system of the target media or device.

**Synonyms:**

file system parsing, 

**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- The Sleuth Kit - allows parsing of file system structures
- X-Ways Forensics - allows parsing of file system structures
