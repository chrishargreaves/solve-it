# T1012

**ID:** T1012

**Name:** Hardware write blockers

**Description:**

A hardware write blocking device [should] prevent any change to data in the user area of a hard drive while allowing access to all data on a hard drive. (Lyle 2006)

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**

Note that "Sometimes it may be desirable to change a drive configuration to obtain access to otherwise hidden sectors, for example, such as within an HPA (host protected area)." (Lyle 2006) 

**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**



**CASE Output Classes:**



**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1118](W1118.md): Hardware write blocker fails to prevent modifications to the attached device. _(INAC-COR)_
    - M1071: Thorough testing of write blocker against multiple targets to ensure that writes are not possible. 
    - M1072: Regular checks for hardware write blocker firmware updates. 
    - M1073: Subscription to notifications from write blocker vendor for firmware updates or identified problems. 
- [W1119](W1119.md): Hardware write blocker hides the existence of an HPA. _(INCOMP)_
    - M1005: Testing to ensure software and hardware setup detects HPAs 
- [W1120](W1120.md): Hardware write blocker hides the existence of an DCO. _(INCOMP)_
    - M1006: Testing to ensure software and hardware setup detects DCOs
