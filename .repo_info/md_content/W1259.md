# W1259

**Name:** Image format parsing fails to identify or assemble split forensic images

**Weakness classes:** INCOMP, INAC-COR

**Details:** None

**Potential mitigations:**

- M1004: Check hash of image matches hash of source device ([T1042](T1042.md))
- M1009: Check hash of image matches hash of source material 
- M1210: Use a forensic image format with internal integrity and continuity metadata 
- M1211: Test the parsing of split forensic images 
- M1212: Test the parsing of split forensic images with the maximum number of segments possible 
- M1213: Test the parsing of split forensic images with missing segments 
- M1214: Ensure forensic tool UI clearly warns that there are problems while parsing a split forensic image file 
- M1215: Test the parsing of split forensic images with a corrupt segment
