**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1195: Keyword results from a tool are associated with a file, but the result was within slack space and therefore it may not have been part of that file](W1195.md) _(INAC-AS, MISINT)_
    - [M1151: Check keyword results are part of allocated file, or if not perform detailed analysis to determine if the association between keyword results and file is valid](M1151.md)
