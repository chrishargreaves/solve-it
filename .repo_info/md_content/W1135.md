# W1135

**Name:** Recovered (non-allocated) file content has been overwritten by the content of a newer live file but this is not detected 

**Weakness classes:** INAC-AS, MISINT

**Details:** None

**Potential mitigations:**

- M1079: Analyse file content to detect incompatibility between the content and the recovered file system metadata 
- M1080: Use a hashset of known files to detect that recovered content does not match the expected file content 
- M1081: Check if recovered content matches with size in metadata e.g. file footer at expected location. 
- M1082: Analyse file system to find any duplicate references to blocks that are referenced by the non-allocated file 
- M1083: Analyse content for embedded timestamps to find that content is a newer file than indicated by metadata (beware of file tunneling)
