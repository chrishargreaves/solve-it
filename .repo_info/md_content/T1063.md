# T1063

**ID:** T1063

**Name:** Identify file types

**Objective(s):** Access partitions, volumes and file systems data

**Description:**

Applying a process that identifies the types of files.

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**

This could be via extension, although files may have been renamed, and so this is unreliable, so other means such as examining a file signature or other techniques are used (Dubettier et al 2023)

**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**



**Output Classes:**
