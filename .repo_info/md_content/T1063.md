# T1063

**ID:** T1063

**Name:** Identify file types

**Description:**

Applying a process that identifies the types of files.

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**

This could be via extension, although files may have been renamed, and so this is unreliable, so other means such as examining a file signature or other techniques are used (Dubettier et al 2023)

**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**



**CASE Output Classes:**



**Potential weaknesses and mitigations:**

- W1129: File type is incorrectly identified _(INAC-AS)_
    - M1109: Testing that tool(s) identify file types correctly 
    - M1111: Use of multiple tools to classify file types 
    - M1112: Use of AI to classify files in addition to standard programmatic methods 
- W1130: Missing assignment of a file type: reporting a file as unknown when it has a known type within the digital forensic science body of knowledge  _(INAC-AS)_
    - M1109: Testing that tool(s) identify file types correctly 
    - M1110: Manual review of files classified as unknown 
    - M1111: Use of multiple tools to classify file types 
    - M1112: Use of AI to classify files in addition to standard programmatic methods 
- W1131: Missing recognition of multiple file types: reporting a file as a limited set of types, or a single type, when it can be interpreted as having more than one, such as a GIF and Java Jar _(INCOMP, INAC-AS)_
    - M1109: Testing that tool(s) identify file types correctly 
    - M1111: Use of multiple tools to classify file types 
    - M1112: Use of AI to classify files in addition to standard programmatic methods
