# T1126

**ID:** T1126

**Name:** Keyword search (live) (physical)

**Description:**

Searching for keywords over the raw data on a sector by sector basis

**Synonyms:**

live search, 

**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**



**Output Classes:**

- [https://ontology.solveit-df.org/solveit/observable/KeywordSearchResult](https://ontology.solveit-df.org/solveit/observable/KeywordSearchResult)


**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1193](W1193.md): Keyword results missed since relevant keyword is split over a sector or cluster boundary _(INCOMP)_
    - M1143: Use live logical keyword search ([T1127](T1127.md))
    - M1144: Use indexed keyword search ([T1124](T1124.md))
- [W1194](W1194.md): Keyword results missed since relevant keyword is inside compressed or encoded data _(INCOMP)_
    - M1143: Use live logical keyword search ([T1127](T1127.md))
    - M1144: Use indexed keyword search ([T1124](T1124.md))
- [W1195](W1195.md): Keyword results from a tool are associated with a file, but the result was within slack space and therefore it may not have been part of that file _(INAC-AS, MISINT)_
    - M1151: Check keyword results are part of allocated file, or if not perform detailed analysis to determine if the association between keyword results and file is valid
