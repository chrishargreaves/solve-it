**ID:** T1126

**Name:** Keyword search (live) (physical)

**Objective(s):** Locate potentially relevant content

**Description:**

Searching for keywords over the raw data on a sector by sector basis

**Synonyms:**

**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**



**Output Classes:**

- [https://ontology.solveit-df.org/solveit/observable/KeywordSearchResult](https://ontology.solveit-df.org/solveit/observable/KeywordSearchResult)


**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1193: Keyword results missed since relevant keyword is split over a sector or cluster boundary](W1193.md) _(INCOMP)_
    - [M1143: Use live logical keyword search](M1143.md) (links to: [T1127](T1127.md))
    - [M1144: Use indexed keyword search](M1144.md) (links to: [T1124](T1124.md))
- [W1194: Keyword results missed since relevant keyword is inside compressed or encoded data](W1194.md) _(INCOMP)_
    - [M1143: Use live logical keyword search](M1143.md) (links to: [T1127](T1127.md))
    - [M1144: Use indexed keyword search](M1144.md) (links to: [T1124](T1124.md))
- [W1195: Keyword results from a tool are associated with a file, but the result was within slack space and therefore it may not have been part of that file](W1195.md) _(INAC-AS, MISINT)_
    - [M1151: Check keyword results are part of allocated file, or if not perform detailed analysis to determine if the association between keyword results and file is valid](M1151.md)
