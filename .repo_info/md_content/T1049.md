# T1049

**ID:** T1049

**Name:** Keyword searching

**Description:**

This technique involves searching data in the case for specific strings

**Synonyms:**

string search, 

**Details:**

This search may be conducted live, directly over the data, or from a generated index of strings extracted from the data. The words searched for may be either case-specific, or sometimes case-type specific.

**Subtechniques:**

- [T1125 - Keyword search (live)](T1125.md)
- [T1126 - Keyword search (live) (physical)](T1126.md)
- [T1127 - Keyword search (live) (logical)](T1127.md)
- [T1124 - Keyword search (indexed)](T1124.md)
- [T1121 - Keyword indexing](T1121.md)
- [T1122 - Keyword search (case-type wordlists)](T1122.md)
- [T1123 - Keyword search (case-specific wordlists)](T1123.md)
- [T1151 - Keyword search (over extracted artifacts)](T1151.md)


**Examples:**



**CASE Output Classes:**



**Potential weaknesses and mitigations:**

- [W1053](W1053.md): Incorrect parsing of a supplied regular expression used for keyword searching _(INCOMP, INAC-EX, INAC-AS)_
    - M1035: Verification against second tool with known different regex implementation 
    - M1036: Testing of regular expression component of tool 
- [W1058](W1058.md): Results appear in an ‘artefact’ or ‘result’ but the context, source or provenance of result is unclear _(MISINT)_
    - M1037: The context of relevant keyword results are manually checked 
- [W1059](W1059.md): Excessive keyword results returned from case-type wordlists such that careful review of all results is impractical _(INCOMP)_
    - M1032: Evaluation of the effectiveness of wordlist used for case-type searching 
    - M1033: Prioritization of search results based on context 
    - M1038: Word list selected such that a practically reviewable number of results are returned 
- [W1196](W1196.md): One or more files with relevant keyword results are missed since they are not stored as text, e.g. within an image _(INCOMP)_
    - M1145: Apply OCR to files and search or index resulting text
