# T1049

**ID:** T1049

**Name:** Keyword searching

**Objective(s):** Locate potentially relevant content

**Description:**

This technique involves searching data in the case for specific strings

**Synonyms:**

string search, 

**Details:**

This search may be conducted live, directly over the data, or from a generated index of strings extracted from the data. The words searched for may be either case-specific, or sometimes case-type specific.

**Subtechniques:**

- [T1125 - Keyword search (live)](T1125.md)
- [T1126 - Keyword search (live) (physical)](T1126.md)
- [T1127 - Keyword search (live) (logical)](T1127.md)
- [T1124 - Keyword search (indexed)](T1124.md)
- [T1121 - Keyword indexing](T1121.md)
- [T1122 - Keyword search (case-type wordlists)](T1122.md)
- [T1123 - Keyword search (case-specific wordlists)](T1123.md)
- [T1151 - Keyword search (over extracted artifacts)](T1151.md)

    - [M1038: Word list selected such that a practically reviewable number of results are returned](M1038.md)
- [W1196: One or more files with relevant keyword results are missed since they are not stored as text, e.g. within an image](W1196.md) _(INCOMP)_
    - [M1145: Apply OCR to files and search or index resulting text](M1145.md)
