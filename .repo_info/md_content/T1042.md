# T1042

**ID:** T1042

**Name:** Disk image hash verification

**Description:**

Computing the hash function of the entire contents of a disk, recording it, and then subsequently computing the hash over any disk image created to detect if any content is different (adapted from Lyle 2002)

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**



**Output Classes:**

- [https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/hash](https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/hash)


**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1042](W1042.md): Disk image was tampered with, but manipulated to have a collision with original hash _(INAC-COR)_
    - M1021: Verify the disk image integrity with multiple hash algorithms e.g. MD5 and SHA1 (Kessler 2016) 
    - M1022: Restrict access to stored disk images 
    - M1023: Ensure and check logs of access to stored disk images 
    - M1070: Ensure hash algorithm(s) used are resistant to collisions through data manipulation 
- [W1124](W1124.md): Failure to compute hash correctly: this could result in a message indicating corrupt evidence, thus stopping or delaying further investigation _(INAC-AS)_
    - M1075: Testing programme to validate hashes of data in images is calculated correctly 
    - M1085: Use of multiple tools to verify disk image hash 
- [W1125](W1125.md): Failure to validate hash properly: this could allow errors from earlier to propagate e.g. incorrect sectors _(INAC-COR)_
    - M1075: Testing programme to validate hashes of data in images is calculated correctly 
    - M1085: Use of multiple tools to verify disk image hash 
- [W1126](W1126.md): Failure to validate hash properly allowing an incomplete disk image to present as validated _(INCOMP)_
    - M1075: Testing programme to validate hashes of data in images is calculated correctly 
    - M1085: Use of multiple tools to verify disk image hash 
- [W1127](W1127.md): Failure to validate metadata: this could allow details such as acquisition date to be changed _(INAC-COR)_
    - M1076: Testing programme to validate hashes of metadata in images is calculated correctly 
- [W1128](W1128.md): Image replaced with tampered version along with updated stored hash _(INAC-COR)_
    - M1022: Restrict access to stored disk images 
    - M1023: Ensure and check logs of access to stored disk images 
    - M1074: Validate image hash against one stored externally to the image in a trusted location.
