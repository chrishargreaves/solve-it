# T1042

**ID:** T1042

**Name:** Disk image hash verification

**Objective(s):** Read data from digital evidence storage formats

**Description:**

Computing the hash function of the entire contents of a disk, recording it, and then subsequently computing the hash over any disk image created to detect if any content is different (adapted from Lyle 2002)

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**



**Output Classes:**
