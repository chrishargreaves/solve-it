**ID:** T1151

**Name:** Keyword search (over extracted artifacts)

**Description:**

Keyword searching only applied over extracted artifacts

- Using Keywords with Magnet AXIOM (McQuaid 2017)


**CASE Output Classes:**



**Potential weaknesses and mitigations:**

- W1257: Missing content that is relevant to a keyword search but it has not been extracted as 'artifacts' _(INCOMP)_
    - M1203: Use indexed keyword search over broader content of the data source ([T1124](T1124.md))
    - M1204: Use live keyword search over broader content of the data source ([T1125](T1125.md))
