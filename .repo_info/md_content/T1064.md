# T1064

**ID:** T1064

**Name:** File carving

**Description:**

The process of recovering files from non-allocated space using only the structural properties of files.

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**

File carving should result in not just the file content, but the offset in which it was found and the offset base (i.e. the disk, volume, or offset within another file). This approach uses internal files structural information only - if residual file system metadata is used then the complementary technique T1150 is more applicable.

**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- Photorec (Grenier 2023)
- scalpel
- foremost

**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1103](W1103.md): Failure to carve salvageable content _(INCOMP)_
    - M1078: Use of multiple carving tools and comparing results 
- [W1104](W1104.md): Incorrect carving of a complete file _(INAC-ALT, INAC-COR)_
    - M1062: Verify semantic integrity of carved content using manual inspection of relevant data 
    - M1063: Verify semantic integrity of carved content using an automated tool 
    - M1064: Verify that salvaged content is renderable using visual inspection of displayed/rendered content  
    - M1090: Compare carved results against known files (e.g. from another source) 
- [W1105](W1105.md): Incorrect reassembly of a file _(INAC-ALT, INAC-COR)_
    - M1062: Verify semantic integrity of carved content using manual inspection of relevant data 
    - M1063: Verify semantic integrity of carved content using an automated tool 
    - M1064: Verify that salvaged content is renderable using visual inspection of displayed/rendered content  
    - M1090: Compare carved results against known files (e.g. from another source) 
- [W1106](W1106.md): Incorrect attribution of salvaged content to a current file system rather than a previous one _(INAC-AS, MISINT)_
    - M1061: Use digital stratigraphy to attempt to attribute data within a specific file system 
- [W1107](W1107.md): Failure to repair a content fragment _(INCOMP, INAC-COR)_
    - M1060: Repair salvaged content by grafting different reference data onto fragment(s) ([T1099](T1099.md))
    - M1065: Render salvaged content by reconstructing a container around fragment(s) based on detected video frame and audio sample locations and (if available) a reference video file with similar parameters.
