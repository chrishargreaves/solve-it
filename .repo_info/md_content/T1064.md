**ID:** T1064

**Name:** File carving

**Description:**



**Synonyms:**



**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**



**CASE Output Classes:**

    - observable:File
    - observable:rangeOffset
    - observable:rangeOffsetType


**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1103](W1103.md): Failure to carve salvageable content _(INCOMP)_
    - M1078: Use of multiple carving tools and comparing results 
- [W1104](W1104.md): Incorrect carving of a complete file _(INAC-ALT, INAC-COR)_
    - M1062: Verify semantic integrity of carved content using manual inspection of relevant data 
    - M1063: Verify semantic integrity of carved content using an automated tool 
    - M1064: Verify that salvaged content is renderable using visual inspection of displayed/rendered content  
    - M1090: Compare carved results against known files (e.g. from another source) 
- [W1105](W1105.md): Incorrect reassembly of a file _(INAC-ALT, INAC-COR)_
    - M1062: Verify semantic integrity of carved content using manual inspection of relevant data 
    - M1063: Verify semantic integrity of carved content using an automated tool 
    - M1064: Verify that salvaged content is renderable using visual inspection of displayed/rendered content  
    - M1090: Compare carved results against known files (e.g. from another source) 
- [W1106](W1106.md): Incorrect attribution of salvaged content to a current file system rather than a previous one _(INAC-AS, MISINT)_
    - M1061: Use digital stratigraphy to attempt to attribute data within a specific file system 
- [W1107](W1107.md): Failure to repair a content fragment _(INCOMP, INAC-COR)_
    - M1060: Repair salvaged content by grafting different reference data onto fragment(s) ([T1099](T1099.md))
    - M1065: Render salvaged content by reconstructing a container around fragment(s) based on detected video frame and audio sample locations and (if available) a reference video file with similar parameters.
