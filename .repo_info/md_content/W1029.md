# W1029

**Name:** Memory smearing may result in pointers being inconsistent within the memory image

**Weakness classes:** INAC-AS, INAC-COR

**Details:** None

**Potential mitigations:**

- M1086: Acquire the parts of memory with interconnected data first, before proceeding with a sequential acquisition. 
- M1088: If applicable, leverage hardware virtualization utilities to add a hypervisor to the system, i.e., virtualize the original system. This allows to either freeze the system before the acquisition or, if the system should not be completely frozen, to copy pages before they are modified.
