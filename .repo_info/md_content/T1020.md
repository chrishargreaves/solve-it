# T1020

**ID:** T1020

**Name:** Mobile file system extraction

**Description:**

Accessing the file system(s) of the device and extracting a set of files (full or partial depending on level of access)

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**

Note that Fukami et al (2021) states "In order to conduct effective file system extraction, rooting the device is required." See T1040. Usually results in a zip/tar file. Rooting may provide access to the file system, but files may still be encrypted. Attacking the user pin, usually on device, using T1034, or T1035 may be necessary, unless the PIN can be obtained from the device user (T1037)

**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**



**CASE Output Classes:**

    - observable:ArchiveFile


**Potential weaknesses and mitigations:**

- [W1159](W1159.md): Presenting a mobile file system acquisition as a bitwise copy of the device _(MISINT)_
    - M1114: Clear use of language around mobile file system extractions, making the limitations clear and differentiating from a full disk image 
- [W1160](W1160.md): Failure to copy relevant files from the mobile device _(INCOMP)_
- [W1161](W1161.md): Lack of privileges for file system acquisition _(INCOMP)_
    - M1113: Use mobile exploit to gain privileged access ([T1040](T1040.md))
- [W1162](W1162.md): Changing relevant files during file system acquisition _(INCOMP, INAC-ALT)_
- [W1163](W1163.md): Changing relevant file metadata during file system acquisition _(INCOMP, INAC-ALT)_
- [W1164](W1164.md): Files are still encrypted using file-based encryption so inaccessible _(INCOMP)_
    - M1115: Attempt to brute force user PIN (potentially on device) ([T1034](T1034.md))
    - M1116: Attempt to dictionary attack user PIN (potentially on device) ([T1035](T1035.md))
    - M1117: Attempt to obtain user PIN from user ([T1037](T1037.md))
