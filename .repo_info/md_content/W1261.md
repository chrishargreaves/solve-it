# W1261

**Name:** Estimated clock offset is incorrect resulting from an inaccurate external time source when performing Time Anchoring

**Weakness classes:** INAC-EX, MISINT

**Details:** None

**Present in techniques:**

- [T1134: Use time anchors to estimate clock offset](T1134.md)


**Potential mitigations:**

- [M1217: Consider multiple time anchors and check if timestamps from multiple external time sources agree](M1217.md)
- [M1220: Periodically keep records of time offsets of significant external servers](M1220.md) (links to: [T1110](T1110.md))
