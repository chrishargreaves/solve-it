# T1153

**ID:** T1153

**Name:** Apply offset to a timestamp

**Description:**

Application of a time offset to a timestamp

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**

This could be a clock offset, a timezone or other reason for a timestamp correction

**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**



**CASE Output Classes:**



**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1264](W1264.md): Offset applied to timestamp is incorrect due to failure to distinguish UTC stored timestamp from local timestamp _(INAC-EX, MISINT)_
    - M1223: Apply time zone based offsets only to UTC stored timestamps 
    - M1226: Testing to determine whether a timestamp is in UTC or local time 
- [W1265](W1265.md): Offset applied to timestamp is incorrect due to variations in time zone over the history of data source _(INAC-EX)_
    - M1224: Check for location artifacts to infer the time zone at a specific moment 
- [W1267](W1267.md): Offset applied to timestamp is incorrect due to variations in clock offset over the history of data source _(INAC-EX)_
    - M1225: Estimate clock offset at a specific point in time using time anchoring ([T1134](T1134.md))
- [W1268](W1268.md): Offset applied to timestamp is incorrect due to incorrect daylight savings configuration used _(INAC-EX)_
    - M1224: Check for location artifacts to infer the time zone at a specific moment
