# W1256

**Name:** Incorrect attribution of metadata to file content that was the result of 'file tunnelling'

**Weakness classes:** INAC-AS, MISINT

**Details:** None

**Potential mitigations:**

- M1079: Analyse file content to detect incompatibility between the content and the recovered file system metadata 
- M1080: Use a hashset of known files to detect that recovered content does not match the expected file content 
- M1081: Check if recovered content matches with size in metadata e.g. file footer at expected location.
