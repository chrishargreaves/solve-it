**ID:** T1150

**Name:** Recover non-allocated files using residual file metadata

**Description:**

    - observable:mftRecordChangeTime
    - observable:mftFileID
    - observable:filePath
    - observable:fileName
    - observable:ntfsOwnerID
    - observable:ntfsOwnerSID
    - observable:ownerSID
    - observable:allocationStatus


**Potential weaknesses and mitigations:**

- W1134: Recovered (non-allocated) file content has been overwritten by the content of a newer, but also non-allocated file (which has residual file system information) but this is not detected  _(INAC-AS, MISINT)_
    - M1079: Analyse file content to detect incompatibility between the content and the recovered file system metadata 
    - M1080: Use a hashset of known files to detect that recovered content does not match the expected file content 
    - M1081: Check if recovered content matches with size in metadata e.g. file footer at expected location. 
    - M1082: Analyse file system to find any duplicate references to blocks that are referenced by the non-allocated file 
    - M1083: Analyse content for embedded timestamps to find that content is a newer file than indicated by metadata (beware of file tunneling) 
- W1135: Recovered (non-allocated) file content has been overwritten by the content of a newer live file but this is not detected  _(INAC-AS, MISINT)_
    - M1079: Analyse file content to detect incompatibility between the content and the recovered file system metadata 
    - M1080: Use a hashset of known files to detect that recovered content does not match the expected file content 
    - M1081: Check if recovered content matches with size in metadata e.g. file footer at expected location. 
    - M1082: Analyse file system to find any duplicate references to blocks that are referenced by the non-allocated file 
    - M1083: Analyse content for embedded timestamps to find that content is a newer file than indicated by metadata (beware of file tunneling) 
- W1253: Recovered (non-allocated) file content has been overwritten by the content of a newer, but also non-allocated file which does not have any residual file system information _(INAC-AS, MISINT)_
    - M1079: Analyse file content to detect incompatibility between the content and the recovered file system metadata 
    - M1080: Use a hashset of known files to detect that recovered content does not match the expected file content 
    - M1081: Check if recovered content matches with size in metadata e.g. file footer at expected location. 
    - M1083: Analyse content for embedded timestamps to find that content is a newer file than indicated by metadata (beware of file tunneling) 
- W1254: Recovered (non-allocated) file content is incorrect due to an incorrect assumption that the file was contiguous e.g. some residual file metadata exists, but not the full reassembly information _(INAC-EX)_
    - M1196: Check if file being recovered is smaller than a block 
    - M1197: Check if file being recovered is resident (applicable on some file systems) 
    - M1079: Analyse file content to detect incompatibility between the content and the recovered file system metadata 
    - M1080: Use a hashset of known files to detect that recovered content does not match the expected file content 
    - M1081: Check if recovered content matches with size in metadata e.g. file footer at expected location. 
- W1255: Recovered file content is incorrect due to incorrect parsing of file size information that records allocated but unwritten sectors (e.g. Valid Data Length (VDL) _(INAC-EX)_
    - M1198: Check if file system and operating system make use of an 'allocated but unwritten' value e.g. VDL. 
    - M1199: Check all relevant file size metadata values when recovering file content 
    - M1200: Ensure that inconsistencies between allocated data size and data written size are clearly flagged. 
    - M1079: Analyse file content to detect incompatibility between the content and the recovered file system metadata 
    - M1080: Use a hashset of known files to detect that recovered content does not match the expected file content 
    - M1081: Check if recovered content matches with size in metadata e.g. file footer at expected location. 
- W1256: Incorrect attribution of metadata to file content that was the result of 'file tunnelling' _(INAC-AS, MISINT)_
    - M1079: Analyse file content to detect incompatibility between the content and the recovered file system metadata 
    - M1080: Use a hashset of known files to detect that recovered content does not match the expected file content 
    - M1081: Check if recovered content matches with size in metadata e.g. file footer at expected location.
