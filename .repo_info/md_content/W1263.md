# W1263

**Name:** Estimated clock offset is incorrect resulting from misinterpretation of locally stored timestamps when performing Time Anchoring

**Weakness classes:** INAC-EX, MISINT

**Details:** None

**Present in techniques:**

- [T1134: Use time anchors to estimate clock offset](T1134.md)


**Potential mitigations:**

- [M1221: Testing of timestamp decoding within a time anchor](M1221.md)
- [M1219: Manual verification of timestamp decoding within a time anchor](M1219.md)
