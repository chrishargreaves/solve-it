**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1037](W1037.md): Presenting data as complete, that is in reality a partial set _(MISINT)_
    - M1016: Alert user that the data collected is a partial set of data stored on the device 
    - M1020: Compare data extracted with full list of installed apps 
- [W1038](W1038.md): Backup process returns an incomplete set of backup data _(INCOMP)_
- [W1039](W1039.md): Backup data collection overwrites important data _(INCOMP, INAC-ALT)_
- [W1040](W1040.md): Not considering SD Card acquisition in addition to other extractions performed _(INCOMP)_
    - M1017: Check for physical presence of SD card 
    - M1018: Check if presence of SD card is expected 
- [W1041](W1041.md): Not considering file system acquisition as alternative _(INCOMP)_
    - M1019: Consider if file system acquisition is possible/permitted ([T1020](T1020.md))
- [W1270](W1270.md): Inability to create a device backup due to locked device _(INCOMP)_
    - M1097: Attempt to obtain password/passcode from the device owner ([T1037](T1037.md))
    - M1234: Exploit device to facilitate password/pincode attacks ([T1040](T1040.md))
    - M1235: Attempt to obtain password/pincode with brute force attacks ([T1034](T1034.md))
    - M1236: Attempt to obtain password/pincode with dictionary attacks ([T1035](T1035.md))
