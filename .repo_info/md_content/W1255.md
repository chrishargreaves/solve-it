# W1255

**Name:** Recovered file content is incorrect due to incorrect parsing of file size information that records allocated but unwritten sectors (e.g. Valid Data Length (VDL)

**Weakness classes:** INAC-EX

**Details:** None

**Potential mitigations:**

- M1198: Check if file system and operating system make use of an 'allocated but unwritten' value e.g. VDL. 
- M1199: Check all relevant file size metadata values when recovering file content 
- M1200: Ensure that inconsistencies between allocated data size and data written size are clearly flagged. 
- M1079: Analyse file content to detect incompatibility between the content and the recovered file system metadata 
- M1080: Use a hashset of known files to detect that recovered content does not match the expected file content 
- M1081: Check if recovered content matches with size in metadata e.g. file footer at expected location.
