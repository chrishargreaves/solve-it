# W1255

**Name:** Recovered file content is incorrect due to incorrect parsing of file size information that records allocated but unwritten sectors (e.g. Valid Data Length (VDL)

**Weakness classes:** INAC-EX

**Details:** None

**Present in techniques:**

- [T1150: Recover non-allocated files using residual file metadata](T1150.md)


**Potential mitigations:**

- [M1198: Check if file system and operating system make use of an 'allocated but unwritten' value e.g. VDL.](M1198.md)
- [M1199: Check all relevant file size metadata values when recovering file content](M1199.md)
- [M1200: Ensure that inconsistencies between allocated data size and data written size are clearly flagged.](M1200.md)
- [M1079: Analyse file content to detect incompatibility between the content and the recovered file system metadata](M1079.md)
- [M1080: Use a hashset of known files to detect that recovered content does not match the expected file content](M1080.md)
- [M1081: Check if recovered content matches with size in metadata e.g. file footer at expected location.](M1081.md)
