# T1134

**ID:** T1134

**Name:** Use time anchors to estimate clock offset

**Description:**

Correlate timestamps from the system clock and an external trusted time source (Time Anchoring)

**Synonyms:**

Timestamp correlation, Time anchoring (Vanini et al 2024), 

**Details:**

Correlate timestamps from the system clock and an external trusted source of time contained in the same artifact, allowing an offset to be estimated *for the point in time the timestamp was recorded*

**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- Browser caches often contain local timestamps and those derived from external servers
- Records in web browser history databases contain local timestamps and, in some cases, timestamps from external servers, embedded in URLs
- Email headers often record timestamps derived from external mail servers as well as timestamps generated by the local system time
- Missed call or voicemail notification messages often include a timestamp derived from an external time source, e.g., missed call from XX on 2018-06-06 at 01:32:49 pm, which can be compared to the local file system time the message was received


**CASE Output Classes:**



**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1260](W1260.md): Failure to derive clock offset due to inability to locate a suitable time anchor _(INCOMP)_
    - M1222: Testing to ensure that tooling is able to extract local/external timestamp pairs (time anchors) 
    - M1218: Ensure that tools and processes take into account all current knowledge on sources of local/external timestamp pairs (time anchors) 
- [W1261](W1261.md): Estimated clock offset is incorrect resulting from an inaccurate external time source when performing Time Anchoring _(INAC-EX, MISINT)_
    - M1217: Consider multiple time anchors and check if timestamps from multiple external time sources agree 
    - M1220: Periodically keep records of time offsets of significant external servers ([T1110](T1110.md))
- [W1262](W1262.md): Estimated clock offset is incorrect resulting from correlating two timestamps that were not written at the same time _(INAC-EX, MISINT)_
    - M1216: Check that the assumption is valid that the specific local/external timestamp pair should be correlated 
- [W1263](W1263.md): Estimated clock offset is incorrect resulting from misinterpretation of locally stored timestamps when performing Time Anchoring _(INAC-EX, MISINT)_
    - M1221: Testing of timestamp decoding within a time anchor 
    - M1219: Manual verification of timestamp decoding within a time anchor
