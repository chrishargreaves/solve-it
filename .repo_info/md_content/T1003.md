# T1003

**ID:** T1003

**Name:** Memory imaging

**Objective(s):** Acquire data

**Description:**

Involves creating a copy of the live memory data of a running system

**Synonyms:**

RAM dump, RAM imaging, memory dump, 

**Details:**



**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- FTK Imager - Can capture both RAM and the pagefile of the system


**Output Classes:**

- [https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/Image](https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/Image)


**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1029: Memory smearing may result in pointers being inconsistent within the memory image](W1029.md) _(INAC-AS, INAC-COR)_
    - [M1086: Acquire the parts of memory with interconnected data first, before proceeding with a sequential acquisition.](M1086.md)
    - [M1088: If applicable, leverage hardware virtualization utilities to add a hypervisor to the system, i.e., virtualize the original system. This allows to either freeze the system before the acquisition or, if the system should not be completely frozen, to copy pages before they are modified.](M1088.md)

- [W1031: Loading a memory imaging tool overwrites relevant data within memory](W1031.md) _(INCOMP)_
- [W1032: Not all memory is acquired](W1032.md) _(INCOMP)_
- [W1033: Data referenced in memory is located within pagefile or swapfile but is not collected](W1033.md) _(INCOMP)_
