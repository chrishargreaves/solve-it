# T1076

**ID:** T1076

**Name:** Log file examination

**Description:**

Examination of a file that was designed for incremental logging from a piece of software (e.g. an application or operating system feature)

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**

These could be in a variety of formats e.g. plain text, JSON, XML, binary, etc.

**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- Examination of setupapi.dev.log
- Examination of syslog


**CASE Output Classes:**

    - observable:EventLog
    - core:eventType


**Potential weaknesses and potential mitigations:**

- [W1228](W1228.md): Log entry missing due to incorrect parsing of logfile _(INCOMP)_
    - M1181: Testing logfile parsing capability 
    - M1027: Dual tool verification 
- [W1229](W1229.md): Log entry missing due to being stored in archived copies of logs _(INCOMP)_
    - M1175: Ensure any available archive logs are also examined 
- [W1230](W1230.md): Log entry missing due to rotation size or timing _(INCOMP)_
    - M1172: Also examine any older versions of the logs from backups 
    - M1173: Check logging settings so the bounds of logging are known 
    - M1175: Ensure any available archive logs are also examined 
- [W1231](W1231.md): Interpreting log entry absence as evidence of deletion rather than logging configuration _(INAC-COR)_
    - M1174: Check logging settings to determine expected behaviour 
- [W1232](W1232.md): Failure to extract log entry timestamp _(INCOMP)_
    - M1180: Testing correct extraction of logfile entry timestamps 
    - M1027: Dual tool verification 
- [W1233](W1233.md): Failure to communicate imprecision in log entry timestamp _(INAC-COR)_
    - M1177: Ensure resolution or limitations of logfile timestamps are understood 
- [W1234](W1234.md): Event time presented incorrectly due to incorrect timezone handling _(INCOMP, INAC-EX, INAC-AS, MISINT)_
    - M1027: Dual tool verification 
    - M1178: Ensure timezone handling method for logfile timestamps is understood 
    - M1179: If timestamp is local time, ensure that the system timezone was applicable at time of log entry generation 
- [W1235](W1235.md): Failure to extract log entry type _(INCOMP)_
    - M1027: Dual tool verification 
    - M1182: Testing of correct log entry type extraction 
- [W1236](W1236.md): Incorrectly interpreting a log entry type based on a different version of the generating software or operating system _(INAC-AS, MISINT)_
    - M1176: Ensure log entry type interpretation applies for the software version being examined
