# T1076

**ID:** T1076

**Name:** Log file examination

**Objective(s):** Extract artifacts, or content of specific types

**Description:**

Examination of a file that was designed for incremental logging from a piece of software (e.g. an application or operating system feature)

**Synonyms:**



**Details:**

These could be in a variety of formats e.g. plain text, JSON, XML, binary, etc.

**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- Examination of setupapi.dev.log
- Examination of syslog


**Output Classes:**

- [https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/EventLog](https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/observable/EventLog)
- [https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/core/eventType](https://ontology.unifiedcyberontology.org/uco/core/eventType)
