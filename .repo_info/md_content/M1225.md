**Name:** Estimate clock offset at a specific point in time using time anchoring

**Details:** None

**Linked technique:** [T1134: Use time anchors to estimate clock offset](T1134.md)

**Potentially mitigates:**

- [W1148: Timestamp used is an inaccurate representation of the real world time due to inaccurate system clock](W1148.md)
- [W1267: Offset applied to timestamp is incorrect due to variations in clock offset over the history of data source](W1267.md)
