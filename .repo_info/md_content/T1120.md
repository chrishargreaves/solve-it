# T1120

**ID:** T1120

**Name:** Automated artifact extraction

**Description:**

The use of automation to extract pieces of data that are potentially useful for a digital forensic investigation

**Synonyms:**

Automated trace extraction, 

**Details:**

Artifacts extracted may be a direct mapping to lower levels of abstraction e.g. a database field 'message content' may map to an artifact 'message content', but in many cases, automated interpretation is applied where a field such as 'flag' containing numeric values, may be mapped to more meaningful text strings in the extracted artifact.

**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- iLEAPP
- aLEAPP
- Axiom
- Hansken


**CASE Output Classes:**

    - analysis:AnalyticResult


**Potential weaknesses and mitigations:**

- [W1189](W1189.md): Artifact extraction is incomplete due to app version changes. _(INCOMP)_
    - M1139: Use automated software monitoring to detect app artefact changes ([T1119](T1119.md))
- [W1190](W1190.md): Interpretation of app data is incorrect due to app version changes. _(MISINT)_
    - M1139: Use automated software monitoring to detect app artefact changes ([T1119](T1119.md))
