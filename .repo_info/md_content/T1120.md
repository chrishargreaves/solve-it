# T1120

**ID:** T1120

**Name:** Automated artifact extraction

**Objective(s):** Extract artifacts, or content of specific types

**Description:**

The use of automation to extract pieces of data that are potentially useful for a digital forensic investigation

**Synonyms:**

Automated trace extraction, 

**Details:**

Artifacts extracted may be a direct mapping to lower levels of abstraction e.g. a database field 'message content' may map to an artifact 'message content', but in many cases, automated interpretation is applied where a field such as 'flag' containing numeric values, may be mapped to more meaningful text strings in the extracted artifact.

**Subtechniques:**



**Examples:**

- iLEAPP
- aLEAPP
- Axiom
- Hansken
