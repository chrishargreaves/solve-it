# W1148

**Name:** Timestamp used is an inaccurate representation of the real world time due to inaccurate system clock

**Weakness classes:** INAC-EX

**Details:** None

**Potential mitigations:**

- M1101: Apply time offset to timestamp ([T1153](T1153.md))
- M1225: Estimate clock offset at a specific point in time using time anchoring ([T1134](T1134.md))
- M1227: Search for indicators of clock tampering ([T1129](T1129.md))
- M1228: Record system clock offset ([T1111](T1111.md))
