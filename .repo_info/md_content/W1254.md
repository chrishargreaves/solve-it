# W1254

**Name:** Recovered (non-allocated) file content is incorrect due to an incorrect assumption that the file was contiguous e.g. some residual file metadata exists, but not the full reassembly information

**Weakness classes:** INAC-EX

**Details:** None

**Present in techniques:**

- [T1150: Recover non-allocated files using residual file metadata](T1150.md)


**Potential mitigations:**

- [M1196: Check if file being recovered is smaller than a block](M1196.md)
- [M1197: Check if file being recovered is resident (applicable on some file systems)](M1197.md)
- [M1079: Analyse file content to detect incompatibility between the content and the recovered file system metadata](M1079.md)
- [M1080: Use a hashset of known files to detect that recovered content does not match the expected file content](M1080.md)
- [M1081: Check if recovered content matches with size in metadata e.g. file footer at expected location.](M1081.md)
