# W1254

**Name:** Recovered (non-allocated) file content is incorrect due to an incorrect assumption that the file was contiguous e.g. some residual file metadata exists, but not the full reassembly information

**Weakness classes:** INAC-EX

**Details:** None

**Mitigations:**

- M1196: Check if file being recovered is smaller than a block 
- M1197: Check if file being recovered is resident (applicable on some file systems) 
- M1079: Analyse file content to detect incompatibility between the content and the recovered file system metadata 
- M1080: Use a hashset of known files to detect that recovered content does not match the expected file content 
- M1081: Check if recovered content matches with size in metadata e.g. file footer at expected location.
