**Potentially mitigates:**

- [W1129: File type is incorrectly identified](W1129.md)
- [W1130: Missing assignment of a file type: reporting a file as unknown when it has a known type within the digital forensic science body of knowledge ](W1130.md)
- [W1131: Missing recognition of multiple file types: reporting a file as a limited set of types, or a single type, when it can be interpreted as having more than one, such as a GIF and Java Jar](W1131.md)
